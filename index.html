It includes a simple HTML page and a JavaScript file that you can use to teach your students how to use codespaces. </p> <p> To get started, open the <code>index.js</code> file and start writing some JavaScript! </p> <p> You can also edit the <code>styles.css</code> file to change the appearance of this page. </p> <p> When you're ready to share this codespace with your students, click the "Share" button in the bottom left corner of the screen. This will copy a link to your codespace to your clipboard. You can then share this link with your students. </p> <p> When your students open the link, they will be prompted to create a GitHub account if they don't already have one. Once they have a GitHub account, they will be able to access your codespace and start coding! </p> </div> <script type="module" src="https://basitx72.github.io/legendary-octo-journey/index.365bf975.js"></script> </body></html>
